The **Social Buttons** particle enables you to quickly and easily add text and/or icon-based links to your various social media accounts. This includes virtually any link from Twitter and Facebook to an RSS feed, and even your email address.

Gantry has built-in support for FontAwesome, which gives you access to a wide variety of social media icons you can quickly add to your particle to make your social buttons stand out.
