Atoms are Particles that do not appear visually on the frontend, but do serve an important purpose. They can be assigned on a per-page basis, or as a default which automatically applies to all of the pages on the site.

For all intents and purposes, Atoms such as **Google Analytics**, and **Custom CSS / JS** add scripting to the page which add or modify the page's scripting during load. This is useful for basic styling such as coloring, and analytics tracking.

Atoms can be assigned in the **Layout Manager** using a special line set up for non-visual particles. This is typically found at the bottom of the **Layout Manager** and Atoms can be dragged into place here in much the same way as regular rendered Particles would on a visible section.

! When using an Atom, the path to a local file is relative to the root of the site, and not to template folder. We recommend using a stream link, such as `gantry-theme://custom/thing.css` as an example, which enables the link to work even if you switch between G5 themes or platforms.

Google Analytics

The **Google Analytics** Atom gives you the ability to quickly add your **Google Analytics UA code** to a Layout, which runs in the background of your page during page load. It adds the necessary scripting around the code you enter in the Atom's **settings**.
