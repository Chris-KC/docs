Gantry 5 was built for the Gantry community. There are many great developers, designers, individuals and businesses that are actively contributing to the Gantry project. This happens through beta testing, adding additional code, committing fixes, reporting issues, and making suggestions.

Another great way people can contribute is by helping others to get the most out of Gantry. That is why we have created this page of great external resources to help bridge the gap between our documentation and common or uncommon real-life use cases.

!!! This area of documentation is set up for free resources provided by third parties - focusing on education and providing tips and tutorials to help users get accustomed to Gantry. We will not add any links that are intended to promote or advertise a specific commercial product, service, or service provider.
