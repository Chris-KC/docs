Gantry 5 was built for the Gantry community. There are many great developers, designers, individuals and businesses that are actively contributing to the Gantry community. This happens through beta testing, adding additional code, doing fixes, reporting issues, and making suggestions.

Another great way people can contribute is by helping others to get the most out of Gantry. That is why we have created this page of great external resources to help bridge the gap between our documentation and common or uncommon real-life use cases.
